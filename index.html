            <p>  The Nigerian government is rife with corruption, allowing the country's top leaders to get away with fraud, petty bribery, and money laundering for personal gain. Nigeria's corruption is blamed on a "oppressive lifestyle and greed. Nnamabia's parents are shocked that the prision Guards took her eldest son away without explanation. This has an impact on the emotions displayed by Nnamabia's parents, who tell the user that the news has broken her heart, as evidenced by the following quotes. "What exactly do you mean?" "Where has my son gone?" "My mother rushed up to him and grabbed his shirt. What happened to my son? "Where has my son gone?"  "They removed him, madam" "Did they take him away? What exactly are you saying? "Did you murder my son?" Nnamabia is released  shortly after, changing his behaviour and attitude, as stated in the following quote: "Nnamabia did not say what happened to him in Cell one, or what happened at the new site."

                <p> Humans can act in a variety of ways in different situations, such as being sad, guilty, or satisfied. In this scenario, we're discussing Nigeria and how human behavior affects it. The police officers bribed by Nnamabia's mother are only interested in personal gain and status, and they have the authority to put you in jail for no reason. Corurption in Nigeria, Somalia and Zambia is dehumnaizing in many ways because it undermines the law enforcement, erodes public trust and perpetuates a culture of impunity. Another example in "Cell one" is one of the cultists hiding from the law, which makes the officers fustrated and decide to go after his family, by imprisioning the cultists grandfather temporary untill they find the culprit. This is a sign that the grandfather's human rights are being violated for no reason and that he is being held in a jail cell until the officers find the true perpetrator. Overall, the dehumanising effects of corruption in Nigeria, Somalia, and Zambia rob citizens of their dignity, rights, and future, undermining the fundamental principles of democracy.

            <p>  The relationship between historical events in Nigeria is the country's corruption and how it began. Back in 2017, it was proposed that by conducting a survey on common finance in Nigeria, factors related to corruption be identified. For example, students' greed, money desires for financial and personal gain, and citizens' low civil participation. Another reason is political corruption in Nigeria's higher ranks. General Abacha and his son Mohammed Sani Abacha were the first to corrupt the country by exporting billions of dollars from the United States government and others, which resulted in the money being laundered through US financial institutions.

            <p>  If corruption persists, citizens may be forced to relocate to other areas. Corruption is a serious problem in African third-world countries such as Nigeria, Somalia, and Zambia. This type of dishonesty is a criminal offence that is tolerated by government officials, resulting in illicit benefits for upper-level officials such as the authorities, law enforcement, and high-ranking officials. Corruption has been rife in Africa for seven years, particularly in Nigeria, Somalia, and Zambia. The president, "Muhammadu Buhari," claimed to have ended corruption in 2015, but this claim has been debunked by locals and news articles by analysing the country's debt, which is approximately 44 trillion Naria.
